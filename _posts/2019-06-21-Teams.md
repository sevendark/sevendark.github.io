Recently, I found that my Teams don't automatically update other people's avatars. I found a lot of ways to clear cache on Windows systems, but there is no information about MAC OS.

There is a very simple way to clear Teams cache:
```sh
$ pwd
/Users/<username>/Library/ApplicationSupport/Microsoft/Teams
$ cd ../
$ rm -rf Teams
```
